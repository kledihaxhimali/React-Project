🧩 Features Implemented (React)
This project makes use of several essential React concepts:
⚛️ Functional Components
  The entire UI is built using functional components for cleaner, more modern code.

⚛️ React Hooks
  Core hooks are used to manage state, lifecycle behavior, and UI logic:
    useState – to manage component-level state
    useEffect – to run side-effects (e.g., fetching data or reacting to changes)
    useRef / useMemo (if included) – to optimize rendering and handle DOM references

🔄 State-Driven UI Updates
    The UI automatically re-renders when state changes, ensuring a reactive and seamless user experience.

🔗 Props for Component Communication
    Components receive and pass data through props, enabling composability and modularity.
